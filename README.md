## Installing

It depends on npm, grunt and bower, and to install just run the following commands:

```
npm install

```

## Starting

You can run locally using the development grunt task:

```
grunt develop
```

It will generate the necessary assets and run up a server into `http://localhost:8180`

## Building

You can build it using the build task and it requires the `--config` parameter (which is the config file for production/development)

```
grunt build --config=production
```

It will generate the project into a `dist` directory


## Deploy

The deploy task runs the build and upload the `dir` dir into the `gh-pages`

```
grunt deploy --config=production
```
